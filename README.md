# Dapr in Codespaces

> Dapr 101 Hands-on Lab

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Overview

This is a template that will setup a Dapr development environment in `GitHub Codespaces`

For ideas, feature requests, and discussions, please use GitHub issues so we can collaborate and follow up.

This Codespace is tested with `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` - it "should" work with bash but hasn't been fully tested. For the HoL, please use zsh to avoid any issues.

You can run the `dev container` locally and you can also connect to the Codespace with a local version of VS Code.

Please experiment and add any issues to the GitHub Discussion. We LOVE PRs!

The motivation for creating and using Codespaces is highlighted by this [GitHub Blog Post](https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/). "It eliminated the fragility and single-track model of local development environments, but it also gave us a powerful new point of leverage for improving GitHubâ€™s developer experience."

Cory Wilkerson, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, recorded a podcast where he shared the GitHub journey to [Codespaces](https://changelog.com/podcast/459)
